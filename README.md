# energycalculator
Snippet for a custom energy calculator built as part of a larger project ca. 2010. It has not been modified since 2010, and only ported to github for reference/to inspire others.

RDX was a specific type of direct exchange ground source ("geothermal") heat pump no longer in production.

This energy calculator was a promotional tool to better help consumers understand their operational costs by converting input costs and operating efficiencies to Millions of BTUs for a more accurate 1:1 comparison.

To use this snippet as-is, you will need a place to house (or local install of) PHP for calculateFuelCost.php. The remainder is completely in old-school Javascript.

calculateFuelCost.php could easily be rewritten in Javascript and included inline if necessary.
